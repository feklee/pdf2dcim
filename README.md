pdf4cam converts PDF documents so that they can be viewed inside a
digital camera as JPEG images. It has been tested with a Ricoh GRⅢ.

If it doesn’t work with your camera:

  * Replace the template file `pdf4cam.jpg` with an image file taken
    with your camera.
    
  * Match the resolution to that of your camera.
